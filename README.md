# DullRazor Hair Removal for Dermoscopic Images
A Preprocessing Script for Skin Lesion Datasets (Python + OpenCV)

A simple way to remove hair from skin lesion images. When working with skin cancer datasets (like ISIC or HAM10000), many images contain hair.
Hair can cover the lesion and make it harder for doctors and machine learning models to see important details.

The script processes an entire dataset with class subfolders and outputs hair-removed images while preserving the original folder structure.
